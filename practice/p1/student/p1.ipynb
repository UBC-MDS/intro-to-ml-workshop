    "    \n",
    "1. We see the test score is a bit higher compared to the cross-validation score. But I would not trust this result too much. Looking at the plot, we can see the cv score plot is quite \"bumpy\" and even if `max_depth=5` is a pretty good value, there is probably also some luck involved there.\n",
    "2. If we are to pick `max_depth` simply based on the training data, it'll pick the lowest value for the parameter as it performs best on the training set. (See the table and plot in 5.1.) That said, that model would be overfit and it won't generalize well on the validation data. That's why we treat it as a hyperparameter and pick the best value based on the cross-validation accuracy. \n",
    "3. Whether the chosen `max_depth` generalizes to other users or not would depend upon how similar the new user is to this user. In other words, whether the training data for this user is representative of the new user or not. That said, the chosen `max_depth` of 5 would most like do better than if we had chosen a higher depth.  \n",
